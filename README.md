# Facial-Recognition_PCA_KNN_using_Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for facial recognition using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, visualization, model training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), dimensionality reduction with PCA, and performance evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes faces from the dataset and the distribution of images per class.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes the KNN algorithm for facial recognition, including a custom implementation of the nearest neighbor search.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applies PCA to reduce the feature space while preserving variance, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.
- **Feature Visualization:** Visualizes the principal components and reconstructs images from reduced dimensions to understand feature extraction.

## Technologies Used
